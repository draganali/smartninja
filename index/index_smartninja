<div class="box"><p>I'm 31 years old with work experience more than ten years. In meantime, I acquired the title of Bachelor of Economy and continued education for Master of Economics. In Ten years of service, I'm doing sales a full seven yrs. A sale can not say that is a branch of economics which still need to learn and be persistent. I see myself in the leading position in the industry with its own sales team. I think that knowledge of the sale should be passed on. I believe in team work, like working in an active team who selflessly communicate with each other and indicates mistakes and are trying to correct. I am very dedicated to work and active in terms of solving daily obligations. Free time I spend with loved ones on excursions or joint gatherings. Actively playing tennis and doing jogging.</p><p><strong>Work experience:</strong></p>
